# Student-Rental-Correlation-Search-with-AirBnb-Data
This project was assigned as a term project for Introduction to Data Science course. Me and another team member trained three different open source data to find correlation between vacancy of shared AirBnb accomodation and distance to educational institutions. As a result, it is found out that rooms nearby the universities are highly desired, as it is assummed that students tend to share flats due to low budget and lack of need for renting whole house
